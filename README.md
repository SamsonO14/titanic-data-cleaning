# üõ≥ Titanic Data Cleaning Project

This project demonstrates **data cleaning and preprocessing** using the famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).  
It was completed in **Python** using `pandas` and `numpy`, as part of my learning journey in data analysis and preparation.

## üîç Project Steps

In the notebook, I go through the following steps:

1. **Loading the dataset**  
   - Importing data with pandas and reviewing dataset info  

2. **Exploring the data**  
   - Checking missing values, data types, and descriptive statistics  

3. **Handling missing values**  
   - Filling or dropping null values where appropriate  

4. **Feature engineering**  
   - Extracting `Title` from names  
   - Creating `FamilySize` and `IsAlone` features  

5. **Data type optimization**  
   - Converting categorical columns to `category` dtype  

6. **Final cleaned dataset**  
   - A dataset ready for further analysis or machine learning

## üìà Next Steps

This project focused on **cleaning** the Titanic dataset. Future steps may include:  

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations (`matplotlib` / `seaborn`)  
- Building a simple predictive model (e.g., logistic regression or decision trees)
